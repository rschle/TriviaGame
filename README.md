# TriviaGame

"Â¡Ay, caramba!" This trivia game tests your knowledge of the longest-running, beloved U.S. television show "The Simpsons." After clicking through Homer's delicious and classic sprinkled donut, you'll have 60 seconds to answer all the questions correctly otherwise you'll let out a loud "D'oh!!" instead of a "Woohoo!".


Definitiely the most challenging part of this assignment was capturing the user input. I struggled quite a lot with this part. Initially I was trying to push the user's answers into an empty array, but I found that it made things more complicated. It was much more straightforward to use a variable that would store the user's answer and then loop through all of the user answers using a for loop.
